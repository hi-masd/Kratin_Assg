Smart Exercise Reminder and Monitoring System

Overview
This repository contains a prototype of a Smart Exercise Reminder and Monitoring System designed to encourage physical activity and track exercise routines for seniors using simulated data.

Architecture Overview
The system architecture involves a React Native mobile application that interacts with simulated data representing exercise metrics such as movement, heart rate, and calories burnt. The application's components manage user interactions, goal setting, exercise reminders, and real-time monitoring, simulating the functionality of a wearable device.

Features
Goal Setting: Users can set personalized exercise goals, specifying exercise duration or target activities.
Exercise Reminders: The system sends timely reminders to encourage exercise sessions based on user-defined schedules.
Real-time Monitoring: Simulated data showcases exercise metrics, including exercise duration, heart rate, and estimated calories burnt.

Technologies Used
•	React Native for the mobile application
•	Simulated data generation for exercise monitoring
•	Basic user interface components for demonstration purposes

Getting Started

Prerequisites
•	Node.js installed
•	React Native development environment set up


Features and Functionalities
•	Goal Setting
•	The app allows users to set exercise goals by specifying duration, type of exercise, and frequency. Goals can be personalized based on the user's health status and preferences.

Exercise Reminders
Users receive reminders prompting them to engage in exercise sessions as scheduled. Reminders are customizable, allowing users to set preferred timings and frequencies.



Real-time Monitoring
Simulated exercise metrics are displayed in the app, including exercise duration, heart rate, and estimated calories burnt. This data is updated periodically to mimic real-time monitoring.

Limitations and Future Improvements
•	The prototype uses simulated data and does not integrate with actual wearable sensors.
•	Future enhancements could include integration with real devices, personalized health data tracking, and advanced exercise recommendations based on user performance.
•	Additional Notes and Contributions
•	Contributions to enhance this prototype or integrate it with real sensor devices are welcome. Developers can fork the repository, make improvements, and submit pull requests to contribute to its development.
